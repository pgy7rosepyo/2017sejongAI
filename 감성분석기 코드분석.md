  "This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope. Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile.",Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd Red Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been institutionalized.The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance.Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever.

Movie reviewpredictions:

 

Review: If youhaven't seen The Godfather before, the most important thing you can do beforewatching is to forget about all of the greatest film of all time hype. That'sonly likely to set up expectations that could never be met; more than likelyyou'll be disappointed. Just think of it as one of the better films from one ofHollywood's more admirable but relatively odder directors, featuring earlierperformances from a very well known cast, and keep in mind that it's as much ahistorical family saga as a crime or gangster film.

Predictedsentiment: Positive

### 영화내용과 줄거리를 제거했을 때, Probability가 최대치가 나온다. 즉, 작성자의 의견에는 부정적인 단어나,의미를 담긴 내용이 없다는 것이다. 영화 내용과 줄거리를 서술할 때 쓰인 부정적인 문장들이 Probability  의 수치를 낮춘 원인이 된 것 같다.

ex) "He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. "

"His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to feel anything at all"
